Vnc Thumbnail Viewer gives you the ability to connect to and watch multiple computers at the same time using the VNC protocol. It presents live thumbnail views of many computers in a single window, scaling and rescaling the views to best fit.  Double-clicking on a single thumbnail will allow you to enlarge it and take control of that computer's keyboard and mouse.
